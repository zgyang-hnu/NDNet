# NDNet
This repository is the implementation of "Narrow while deepnet work for real-time semantic segmenation"

We have tested our code on Ubuntu 16.04, Pytorch 1.0


#Requirements:

Pytorch 1.0

#Usage

##1 Prepare the data  
You need first to download the Cityscapes dataset by yourself, since the Cityscape use 19 class label for semantic segmentation task, you also need to convert the original 33 class label image to 19 class image using the code provided by the Cityscapes team

##2 set the parameters  
All the parameters are manally set in the Seg_NDnet/train.py.  
The parameters you need to change may be the path of the Cityscape dataset.

##3 Train  
You can train the model just with after cd to the menu Seg_NDnet:   
python train.py  
If there are any other error message about "python package can not find", use "pip intall xx" to setup   

##4 Test  
After the training completed, set the "RESTORE_FROM" in "Seg_NDnet/infer_citys.py" with the path at which your model saved, and then run     
python infer_citys.py  
this command will make prediction over the val set one by one and save the prediction to the path you specified

##ï¼•Compute miou  
We use the code provided by the Cityscape team to compute miou of test;  
The code is located at 'Cityscape-master/cityscapescripts/evaluation/evalPixelLevelSemanticLabeling.py'   
python evalPixelLevelSemanticLabeling.py  
There are two parameters you need to specify    
line 52 PRED_PATH='the path of saved prediction (gray label)images'  
line 667  groundTruthImgList = glob.glob('/opt/Cityscapes/gtFine_trainvaltest/gtFine/val/*/*_gtFine_labelIds.png'(the path of gt images))
